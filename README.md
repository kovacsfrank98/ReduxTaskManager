# App created by Frank Kovacs

## Overview

As the name implies, this app is a simple task manager where you can input, complete, and delete whatever you input in this to-do list.

### Function

To begin, simply enter a task in the text bar, and hit enter to push it into your list. Click the button that appears with your task to determine what to do next. Click 'Done' if your task is complete. Click 'Delete' if you don't want to keep the event on the list anymore.

### Technologies Used

.js, .css, React, React-Redux

### Future Improvements

1) Make a more impressive looking website.
2) Allow for more options to tasks, such as editing
3) Make the Add-Todo a separate page
